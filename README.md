# Weather App

A weather web app that allows the user to look up a city (in the US), and displays a graph of the temperature, pressure, and humidity over a 5 day period.
<br />
This was done using React, Redux, Bootstrap, and the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/forecast5).

Note: Used starter code from https://github.com/StephenGrider
